**Adaptions of the work must be freely accessible to everyone with little effort**

My intention:
- I want the repository to reflect the 'best' versions of the patterns
- Therefore, I want, that anyone shares improvements/adaptions of the work (so that I can see thoughts of others)
- I do not want, that someone uses the work commercially without sharing their insights
